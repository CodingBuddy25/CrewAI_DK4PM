# Integrating Process Mining and Regulatory Risk Management in Wells Fargo's Loan Application Process

## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving financial services landscape, major banks like Wells Fargo are under constant pressure to enhance operational efficiency while managing regulatory risks. The loan application process is a critical area where these challenges converge. Process mining, a data-driven technique that extracts insights from event logs, has emerged as a transformative tool for optimizing loan origination processes. This report explores the intersection of process mining, Wells Fargo’s loan application process, and regulatory risk, providing actionable insights and recommendations based on recent authoritative sources.

## The Regulatory Landscape and Its Impact on Wells Fargo

### Regulatory Challenges and Developments

Wells Fargo has been under intense regulatory scrutiny, particularly following the 2016 "fake accounts" scandal. As of May 2025, the bank has resolved numerous consent orders, with only two major regulatory actions remaining open: a 2015 consent order related to Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act violations and a 2024 formal agreement concerning anti-money laundering ([MPA Mag, 2025](https://www.mpamag.com/us/mortgage-industry/industry-trends/cfpb-keeps-clearing-wells-fargos-consent-orders/533749); [PYMNTS, 2025](https://www.pymnts.com/news/regulation/2025/wells-fargo-says-cfpb-ended-compliance-risk-consent-order/)). These regulatory challenges have significantly influenced Wells Fargo's loan application process, necessitating stricter controls and enhanced compliance measures.

### Federal Reserve Asset Cap

The Federal Reserve's $1.95 trillion asset cap, imposed in 2018, has further constrained Wells Fargo's growth and competitive positioning. However, recent regulatory progress has led analysts to speculate that the cap could be lifted as early as Q2 2025 ([PYMNTS, 2025](https://www.pymnts.com/news/regulation/2025/wells-fargo-says-cfpb-ended-compliance-risk-consent-order/)). This potential development underscores the importance of maintaining robust compliance and risk management frameworks.
