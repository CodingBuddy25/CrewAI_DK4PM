## The O2C Process: Common Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies

The O2C process encompasses the entire cycle from receiving a customer order through to payment collection. In large organizations like P&G, this process is often complex, involving multiple systems (ERP, CRM, billing), departments, and manual interventions. Common bottlenecks and inefficiencies include:

- **Manual Order Entry:** Manual processing of purchase orders (POs) is time-consuming and error-prone, leading to delays and increased risk of mistakes ([Conexiom, 2025](https://conexiom.com/blog/top-10-order-to-cash-problems-and-how-to-fix-them)).
- **Data Fragmentation:** Disparate systems result in fragmented data, making reconciliation and validation difficult ([Safebooks, 2025](https://safebooks.ai/resources/financial-data-governance/order-to-cash-process-automation-with-data-validation-and-verification/)).
- **Delayed Validation:** Errors often go undetected until late in the process, causing payment disputes and revenue leakage ([Safebooks, 2025](https://safebooks.ai/resources/financial-data-governance/order-to-cash-process-automation-with-data-validation-and-verification/)).
- **Complex Data Verification:** Matching documents such as POs, invoices, and payment records is labor-intensive when done manually ([Safebooks, 2025](https://safebooks.ai/resources/financial-data-governance/order-to-cash-process-automation-with-data-validation-and-verification/)).
- **Legacy Mindsets:** Cultural resistance to automation and digital transformation can stall progress ([Conexiom, 2025](https://conexiom.com/blog/top-10-order-to-cash-problems-and-how-to-fix-them)).

These issues are not unique to P&G but are prevalent across the industry, as highlighted in multiple recent studies and expert analyses.

These improvements have freed up $5 billion in cash, enabling further investment in automation and process optimization.

### 2. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and AI Adoption

P&G has invested heavily in RPA and AI to address O2C bottlenecks:

- **RPA Implementation:** P&G uses RPA to automate repetitive, rule-based tasks such as ledger updates, order entry, and payment reconciliation. This has reduced the need for manual intervention and improved process speed and accuracy ([EuroFinance, 2019](https://www.eurofinance.com/news/pg-uses-rpa-to-overhaul-supply-chain/)).
- **AI for Data Validation:** AI-driven platforms enable real-time data validation and anomaly detection, ensuring data integrity across O2C steps ([Safebooks, 2025](https://safebooks.ai/resources/financial-data-governance/order-to-cash-process-automation-with-data-validation-and-verification/)).
- **Generative AI in Operations:** P&G is piloting generative AI to optimize content creation, marketing, and even manufacturing operations, further reducing cycle times and costs ([Consumer Goods Technology, 2025](https://consumergoods.com/pg-taps-ai-and-automation-faster-smarter-operations)).

### 3. Process Standardization and Ecosystem Readiness

P&G’s digital transformation journey began with standardizing and simplifying processes before applying automation. This approach ensured that digital solutions were layered onto a stable operational foundation, maximizing ROI and sustainability ([SCMR, 2025](https://www.scmr.com/article/Insiders-view-of-Proctor-and-Gamble-supply-chain-success)).
