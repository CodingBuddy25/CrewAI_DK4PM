## 1. P&G’s Exposure to Cyber Risks: The Blue Yonder Ransomware Attack

### 1.1 Incident Overview

In November 2024, Blue Yonder, P&G’s transportation management system (TMS) provider, suffered a ransomware attack that disrupted its services. This event had the potential to significantly impact P&G’s supply chain and O2C process, as Blue Yonder provides synchronized end-to-end supply chain management solutions ([Cybersecurity Dive, 2025](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/procter-gamble-recovery-blue-yonder/738404/); [OM in the News, 2025](https://ominthenews.com/procter-gambles-supply-chain-resiliency-in-ransomware-attack/)).

### 1.2 P&G’s Response and Resilience

Despite the disruption, P&G’s operations remained largely unhindered. The company rapidly deployed an in-house manual solution within 12 hours, replicating Blue Yonder’s basic functionality and ensuring continued order processing and shipment ([OM in the News, 2025](https://ominthenews.com/procter-gambles-supply-chain-resiliency-in-ransomware-attack/)). According to CFO Andre Schulten, the impact was “relatively benign,” with the company shipping nearly 100% of received orders by early December 2024 ([Cybersecurity Dive, 2025](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/procter-gamble-recovery-blue-yonder/738404/)).

### 1.3 Financial and Operational Impact

While the manual workaround was time- and cost-intensive, P&G managed to avoid significant financial losses or operational backlogs. The company’s backlog of orders, at its peak, represented up to 70 basis points of the quarter, but this was quickly resolved ([Cybersecurity Dive, 2025](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/procter-gamble-recovery-blue-yonder/738404/)). Schulten noted that any short-term shipment delays were due to truck availability rather than IT system failure.
