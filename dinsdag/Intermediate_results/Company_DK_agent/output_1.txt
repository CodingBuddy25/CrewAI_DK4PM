## 1. Understanding Production Bottlenecks in the P&G Context

A production bottleneck is a stage in the manufacturing or supply chain process where the flow of operations is impeded, causing delays, increased costs, and reduced efficiency. For a multinational like P&G, bottlenecks can occur at various points, including raw material sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, and distribution ([Snapl, 2023](https://snapl.com/news/supply-chain-bottlenecks-causes-challenges-and-how-to-navigate-them)). The complexity of P&G’s global operations—spanning over 180 countries and involving hundreds of suppliers—amplifies both the risk and impact of such bottlenecks.

### Key Bottleneck Variables in Manufacturing

Recent academic research identifies several principal variables that contribute to bottlenecks in manufacturing, including:

- Machine breakdowns
- Demand and supply mismatches
- Infrastructure limitations
- Supplier reliability
- Regulatory changes
- Technology failures
- Product heterogeneity
- Workload variability ([PMC, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8144007/))

These factors are highly relevant to P&G’s operations, given its reliance on high-volume, high-precision manufacturing and global supply networks.

## 2. Evidence of Bottlenecks in P&G’s Production Operations

### Case Study: P&G Vallejo Plant, Mexico

A concrete example of a production bottleneck at P&G is found at its Vallejo manufacturing plant in Mexico. Here, the plant faced significant operational challenges due to an outdated railcar unloading system for soda ash, a key raw material for laundry detergent production. The system was only capable of conveying 11 tons per hour, far below the required 25 tons per hour, resulting in decreased efficiency, excessive air consumption, and costly maintenance. This bottleneck led to production interruptions and increased operational costs, estimated to be three times higher than if the system operated at optimal capacity ([Cyclonaire, 2020](https://www.cyclonaire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PG_CaseStudy.pdf)).

#### Table 1: Impact of Bottleneck at P&G Vallejo Plant

| Metric                 | Pre-Upgrade Value | Optimal Value | Bottleneck Impact                |
|------------------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| Conveying Rate (tons/hr)| 11                | 25           | 56% below optimal                |
| Maintenance Costs      | High              | Lower        | 3x higher than optimal           |
| Air Consumption        | Excessive         | Reduced      | Increased operational expenses   |
| Production Efficiency  | Decreased         | Increased    | Lost opportunity, higher costs   |

### Broader Supply Chain and Production Challenges

P&G’s global operations are also susceptible to bottlenecks arising from:

- **Supplier Disruptions:** Reliance on third-party suppliers increases exposure to raw material shortages and price volatility. Delays in logistics can affect product availability and sales ([Latterly, 2025](https://www.latterly.org/procter-gamble-pg-swot-analysis/)).
- **Geopolitical Tensions:** Trade restrictions, tariffs, and regional instability can disrupt supply routes and increase costs ([Monexa, 2025](https://www.monexa.ai/blog/p-g-2025-growth-trends-challenges-PG-2025-02-19)).
- **Technology Integration:** While digital transformation is a strategic priority, the adoption of new technologies can itself create temporary bottlenecks if not managed carefully ([SCMR, 2023](https://www.scmr.com/article/Insiders-view-of-Proctor-and-Gamble-supply-chain-success)).
- **Demand Surges:** Sudden increases in consumer demand, such as during crises or product launches, can strain production capacity and logistics ([Snapl, 2023](https://snapl.com/news/supply-chain-bottlenecks-causes-challenges-and-how-to-navigate-them)).
