## 1. Introduction

Wells Fargo’s journey since the eruption of its account fraud scandal in 2016 has been marked by a series of regulatory actions, consent orders, fines, and mandated reforms. These regulatory interventions have targeted deficiencies in risk management, compliance, mortgage servicing, loan origination, and anti-money laundering (AML) controls. The bank’s efforts to resolve these issues have been closely monitored by regulators, investors, and the public, with significant repercussions for its lending operations and customer experience ([Wells Fargo, 2025](https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/basel-disclosures/2025-first-quarter-pillar-3-disclosure.pdf)).

## 2. Overview of Regulatory Risks Facing Wells Fargo

### 2.1. Consent Orders and Enforcement Actions

Since 2011, Wells Fargo has been subject to at least 15 major consent orders from federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve (Fed), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). These orders have addressed:

- Mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices
- Auto lending and insurance practices
- Compliance risk management
- Anti-money laundering (AML) deficiencies
- Consumer protection violations

As of June 2025, Wells Fargo has resolved 12 consent orders since 2019, including five in 2025 alone. However, three major enforcement actions remain, most notably the Fed’s asset cap and an OCC agreement on AML ([MPA, 2025a](https://www.mpamag.com/us/news/general/wells-fargo-clears-another-regulatory-hurdle-cuts-down-consent-orders-to-three/528920); [AINVEST, 2025](https://www.ainvest.com/news/wells-fargo-regulatory-milestone-step-challenges-remain-2504/)).

### 2.2. The Federal Reserve Asset Cap

Imposed in February 2018, the Fed’s asset cap restricts Wells Fargo’s total assets to $1.95 trillion. This unprecedented measure was a direct response to “widespread compliance issues,” including the infamous fake accounts scandal ([Yahoo Finance, 2025](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-sheds-fourth-consent-170358551.html)). The cap limits the bank’s ability to expand its loan book, directly impacting its loan origination and approval processes.

### 2.3. Recent Regulatory Milestones

- **February–April 2025:** The OCC and CFPB terminated several consent orders related to mortgage servicing, compliance risk management, and consumer protection ([MPA, 2025b](https://www.mpamag.com/us/news/general/wells-fargo-clears-two-mortgage-related-consent-orders-from-the-fed/523471); [MPA, 2025c](https://www.mpamag.com/us/mortgage-industry/industry-trends/cfpb-keeps-clearing-wells-fargos-consent-orders/533749)).
- **September 2024:** Wells Fargo entered a new agreement with the OCC to address AML program deficiencies ([MPA, 2025a](https://www.mpamag.com/us/news/general/wells-fargo-clears-another-regulatory-hurdle-cuts-down-consent-orders-to-three/528920)).
- **April 2025:** The CFPB lifted its 2018 consent order, marking the twelfth regulatory closure since 2019 ([AINVEST, 2025](https://www.ainvest.com/news/wells-fargo-regulatory-milestone-step-challenges-remain-2504/)).

## 3. Regulatory Risks and the Loan Application Process

### 3.1. Direct Impacts on Loan Origination

#### 3.1.1. Stricter Underwriting Standards

Regulatory scrutiny has forced Wells Fargo to tighten its loan origination standards, particularly in mortgage and consumer lending. Enhanced documentation, income verification, and compliance checks are now standard, increasing the complexity and duration of the loan application process ([GARPRisk, 2019](https://www.garp.org/risk-intelligence/culture-governance/risk-management-lessons-from-the-wells-fargo-report)).

#### 3.1.2. Technology and Process Overhauls

Consent orders have mandated significant investments in technology to automate compliance checks, monitor risk, and detect anomalies in loan applications. This has improved fraud detection but also introduced new friction points for applicants ([Monexa, 2025](https://www.monexa.ai/blog/wells-fargo-s-strategic-transformation-amid-regula-WFC-2025-02-13)).

#### 3.1.3. Delays and Customer Experience

The need for heightened oversight and documentation has led to longer processing times and, at times, higher denial rates. Borrowers have reported increased requests for supporting documents and more frequent compliance-related queries ([MPA, 2025a](https://www.mpamag.com/us/news/general/wells-fargo-clears-another-regulatory-hurdle-cuts-down-consent-orders-to-three/528920)).

### 3.2. Mortgage Servicing and Loss Mitigation

#### 3.2.1. Historical Failures

Wells Fargo’s mortgage servicing failures, including a calculation error that denied 870 borrowers loan modifications (545 of whom lost their homes), led to a $250 million OCC penalty in 2021 and a 2021 consent order ([MPA, 2025a](https://www.mpamag.com/us/news/general/wells-fargo-clears-another-regulatory-hurdle-cuts-down-consent-orders-to-three/528920)).

#### 3.2.2. Remediation and Current Practices

The bank has since overhauled its loss mitigation practices, implementing stricter controls and enhanced borrower communication protocols. These changes have improved compliance but increased the operational burden on both the bank and applicants ([AINVEST, 2025](https://www.ainvest.com/news/wells-fargo-regulatory-milestone-step-challenges-remain-2504/)).

### 3.3. Compliance Risk Management

#### 3.3.1. Three Lines of Defense

Wells Fargo has adopted the “three lines of defense” model for risk management, as mandated by the OCC’s Heightened Expectations standards. However, past breakdowns in this model contributed to regulatory failures ([GARPRisk, 2019](https://www.garp.org/risk-intelligence/culture-governance/risk-management-lessons-from-the-wells-fargo-report)). The bank has since restructured its risk and compliance teams, increasing oversight of loan origination and approval.

#### 3.3.2. Board and Management Accountability

Regulators have pressured Wells Fargo to upgrade its board risk committee and enhance management accountability. Nearly half of the current risk committee served during the years preceding the retail account scandal, raising concerns about the depth of cultural change ([GARPRisk, 2019](https://www.garp.org/risk-intelligence/culture-governance/risk-management-lessons-from-the-wells-fargo-report)).

## 4. Quantitative and Qualitative Impacts

### 4.1. Financial Performance and Loan Growth

| Metric (Q1 2025)         | Value           | Year-over-Year Change |
|--------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Earnings per Share (EPS) | $1.39           | +16%                 |
| Revenue                  | $20.15 billion  | -                    |
| Net Income               | $4.9 billion    | -                    |
| Shareholder Returns      | $4.8 billion    | -                    |
| Asset Cap                | $1.95 trillion  | Unchanged            |

Despite regulatory headwinds, Wells Fargo has demonstrated financial resilience. However, the asset cap continues to constrain loan growth, limiting the bank’s ability to compete with peers in expanding its lending portfolio ([CWEB, 2025](https://cweb.com/wells-fargos-asset-cap-could-be-lifted-in-2025-as-regulatory-progress-continues/)).

### 4.2. Operational and Reputational Risks

#### 4.2.1. Reputational Damage

The long-term effect of reputation risk far outweighs any short-term business objectives. Wells Fargo’s credibility problem is acute; every statement and initiative is scrutinized against its regulatory history ([GARPRisk, 2019](https://www.garp.org/risk-intelligence/culture-governance/risk-management-lessons-from-the-wells-fargo-report)).

#### 4.2.2. Customer Trust and Application Volumes

Surveys and anecdotal evidence suggest that some borrowers remain wary of Wells Fargo, particularly in mortgage and consumer lending. This has likely contributed to lower application volumes and higher attrition rates compared to pre-scandal levels ([Monexa, 2025](https://www.monexa.ai/blog/wells-fargo-s-strategic-transformation-amid-regula-WFC-2025-02-13)).

Wells Fargo remains an outlier among major U.S. banks in terms of regulatory encumbrances and restrictions on loan growth.

## 6. Strategic and Operational Recommendations

### 6.1. For Wells Fargo

- **Accelerate Consent Order Remediation:** Prioritize closure of the remaining three consent orders, with a focus on AML compliance and systemic risk controls.
- **Enhance Transparency:** Proactively disclose progress on regulatory milestones and improvements in the loan application process to rebuild trust.
- **Invest in Digital Transformation:** Continue investing in digital platforms to streamline loan applications while maintaining robust compliance.
- **Strengthen Board Expertise:** Further diversify the board with members who possess direct risk management experience in banking ([GARPRisk, 2019](https://www.garp.org/risk-intelligence/culture-governance/risk-management-lessons-from-the-wells-fargo-report)).

### 6.2. For Regulators

- **Monitor Cultural Change:** Ensure that reforms are not just procedural but embedded in the bank’s culture.
- **Balance Oversight with Efficiency:** Encourage compliance without unduly burdening the loan application process for qualified borrowers.

### 6.3. For Borrowers

- **Prepare for Enhanced Scrutiny:** Applicants should expect more rigorous documentation and longer processing times.
- **Monitor Regulatory Developments:** Stay informed about Wells Fargo’s regulatory status, as changes may impact product availability and terms.

## 7. Conclusion and Opinion

Wells Fargo’s regulatory risks have fundamentally reshaped its loan application process, imposing higher compliance standards and operational burdens. While the bank has made substantial progress in resolving legacy issues—closing 12 consent orders since 2019 and demonstrating financial resilience—the persistence of the Fed’s asset cap and OCC’s AML agreement underscores the unfinished nature of its recovery. In my assessment, Wells Fargo’s current risk management and compliance frameworks are significantly improved but not yet fully rehabilitated. The bank’s ability to regain its competitive edge in lending will depend on the timely resolution of remaining regulatory actions, continued investment in technology and risk culture, and transparent engagement with stakeholders.

The experience of Wells Fargo serves as a cautionary tale for the industry: regulatory risks, once realized, have enduring impacts on operational processes, reputation, and growth potential. For Wells Fargo, the path forward is promising but contingent on sustained reform and credible execution.
