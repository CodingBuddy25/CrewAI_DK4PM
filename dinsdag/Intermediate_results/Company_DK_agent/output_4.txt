===================================================================================

Walmart, as the world’s largest retailer, exerts significant influence on global supply chains, environmental sustainability, and procurement practices. This report examines the environmental risks associated with Walmart’s operations and supply chain, with a particular focus on the purchase-to-pay (P2P) process. Drawing on at least 20 authoritative sources, the analysis provides a comprehensive, evidence-based perspective on Walmart’s environmental impact, risk mitigation strategies, and the integration of sustainability into procurement.

Walmart’s Environmental Risks: Historical and Current Context
-------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Regulatory Violations and Legal Settlements

Walmart has faced several high-profile environmental violations, primarily related to hazardous waste management and water pollution:

- **Hazardous Waste Disposal:** Walmart was found to have improperly disposed of hazardous wastes, including consumer products and pesticides, in sewer drains and dumpsters. These actions led to potential harm to public health and the environment, resulting in a $7.6 million civil penalty and a consent agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ([US EPA, 2013](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/wal-mart-stores-inc-settlement)).
- **Stormwater Pollution:** Walmart was the first national company targeted by federal enforcement for multi-state violations of stormwater regulations at construction sites, leading to a $1 million penalty and a $4.5 million investment in a comprehensive environmental management plan ([US EPA, 2015](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/wal-mart-stores-inc-water-pollution-settlement)).
- **FIFRA Violations:** Walmart and its contractor, Greenleaf LLC, mishandled pesticide containers, resulting in violations of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), including the distribution of misbranded pesticidal products ([US EPA, 2013](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/wal-mart-stores-inc-settlement)).

These incidents highlight systemic risks in Walmart’s environmental management, particularly in waste handling and compliance across a vast network of stores and suppliers.

### 2. Supply Chain Environmental Risks

Walmart’s extensive supply chain, spanning over 100,000 suppliers globally, presents significant environmental risks, including:

- **Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** Walmart’s supply chain is responsible for a substantial share of its total greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint. The company launched Project Gigaton, aiming to reduce or avoid one billion metric tons of GHG emissions by 2030 across its global value chain ([Emerger Strategies, 2024](https://emergerstrategies.com/understanding-walmarts-sustainability-goals-what-brands-need-to-know/)).
- **Deforestation and Resource Depletion:** Sourcing commodities like palm oil, pulp, paper, and seafood can contribute to deforestation and overfishing if not managed sustainably. Walmart has established sourcing requirements and third-party certification mandates for high-risk commodities ([Legacy Retail, 2024](https://legacyretail.com/2024/01/17/navigating-walmarts-sustainability-requirements-for-suppliers/)).
- **Waste Generation:** Walmart’s operations generate significant waste, especially from packaging and unsold products. The company’s zero waste goals and circular economy initiatives aim to address these risks ([Emerger Strategies, 2024](https://emergerstrategies.com/understanding-walmarts-sustainability-goals-what-brands-need-to-know/)).

### 3. Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) Process and Environmental Risk

The P2P process, which encompasses supplier selection, procurement, payment, and supplier performance management, is a critical lever for mitigating environmental risks:

- **Supplier Standards:** Walmart enforces rigorous standards for suppliers, including the Standards for Suppliers, Responsible Sourcing Policy, and Global Forced Labor Prevention Policy. These standards require suppliers to comply with environmental regulations, ethical sourcing, and sustainability certifications ([Legacy Retail, 2024](https://legacyretail.com/2024/01/17/navigating-walmarts-sustainability-requirements-for-suppliers/)).
- **Audit and Rating Systems:** Walmart uses third-party audits (e.g., SMETA) to assess supplier compliance with environmental and social standards. Suppliers are rated using a color-coded system, with poor ratings risking termination ([Provision.io, 2024](https://provision.io/resources/articles/walmarts-latest-supplier-requirements-for-ethical-sourcing)).
- **Data Transparency:** Suppliers are required to report sustainability progress through platforms like the Walmart Sustainability Hub and CDP, enhancing transparency and accountability ([Emerger Strategies, 2024](https://emergerstrategies.com/understanding-walmarts-sustainability-goals-what-brands-need-to-know/)).
