## 2. Overview of P&Gís O2C Process

P&Gís O2C process typically includes the following phases:

| Phase                  | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Order Entry            | Customer order is received and entered into the system                       |
| Credit Management      | Credit checks and risk assessments are performed                             |
| Order Fulfillment      | Products are picked, packed, and shipped                                     |
| Billing & Invoicing    | Invoices are generated and sent to customers                                |
| Payment Collection     | Payments are received and reconciled                                         |
| Customer Service       | Post-order support and issue resolution                                      |

This process is supported by integrated ERP systems (notably SAP), process mining tools (e.g., Celonis), and digital supply chain platforms ([Panmore Institute, 2024](https://panmore.com/procter-gamble-operations-management-10-decisions-productivity)).

## 3. Identified Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies

### 3.1 Excessive Manual Work and Data Inaccuracies

- **Manual Interventions:** Excessive manual work in order entry, pricing, and invoicing leads to errors, delays, and rework. For example, a case study in the energy sector (applicable to large enterprises like P&G) found that manual data entry caused frequent invoice cancellations, which negatively impacted customer experience ([K‰‰ri‰ & Shamsuzzoha, 2024](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ijppm-01-2022-0050/full/html)).
- **Data Quality Issues:** Errors in master data (e.g., customer information, pricing) result in incorrect shipments, billing mistakes, and increased rework. At P&G, such errors can disrupt downstream processes, from logistics to cash application ([Panmore Institute, 2024](https://panmore.com/procter-gamble-operations-management-10-decisions-productivity)).

### 3.2 System Integration and Automation Gaps

- **ERP and Platform Integration:** While P&G has invested in SAP and other digital tools, integration gaps remain. For example, the Allegro system (in a comparable case company) was cited as a source of system errors, necessitating manual workarounds and causing delays ([K‰‰ri‰ & Shamsuzzoha, 2024](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ijppm-01-2022-0050/full/html)).
- **Limited Automation:** Despite efforts to automate, many O2C sub-processes still rely on manual approvals and interventions, particularly in exception handling and credit management ([Bain & Co, 2020](https://www.scribd.com/document/481449069/New-Ambitions-for-Automation-Bain-Co-15-Oct-2020)).

### 3.3 Process Variability and Lack of Standardization

- **Inconsistent Processes Across Sites:** P&G operates multiple manufacturing and distribution sites globally. Variability in process execution leads to inconsistent performance and complicates root cause analysis ([Nulogy Case Study, 2018](https://www.supplychainbrain.com/ext/resources/0-whitepapers/Nulogy/CaseStudy_PG2018.pdf)).
- **Rework and Redundant Activities:** Repeated activities such as invoice reversals, re-invoicing, and manual updates to billing blocks are common, as illustrated in process mapping exercises ([K‰‰ri‰ & Shamsuzzoha, 2024](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ijppm-01-2022-0050/full/html)).

### 3.4 Bottlenecks in Credit and Payment Processing

- **Credit Invoicing Delays:** A significant portion of sales cases are subject to credit invoicing, which introduces additional steps and increases the risk of payment delays ([K‰‰ri‰ & Shamsuzzoha, 2024](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ijppm-01-2022-0050/full/html)).
- **Payment Reconciliation Issues:** Discrepancies between invoices and payments, often due to data mismatches or system errors, slow down cash application and impact working capital ([Panmore Institute, 2024](https://panmore.com/procter-gamble-operations-management-10-decisions-productivity)).

### 3.5 Lack of Real-Time Visibility and Performance Metrics

- **Limited Process Transparency:** Without real-time dashboards and KPIs, it is difficult for P&G to monitor O2C performance, identify bottlenecks, and drive continuous improvement ([K‰‰ri‰ & Shamsuzzoha, 2024](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ijppm-01-2022-0050/full/html)).
- **Inadequate Metrics:** Key metrics such as order handling time, delivery lead time, and manual change frequency are not consistently tracked, limiting the ability to benchmark and optimize ([Panmore Institute, 2024](https://panmore.com/procter-gamble-operations-management-10-decisions-productivity)).
