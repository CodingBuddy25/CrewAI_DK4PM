Based on the analysis of the provided process flow, here are the important steps and potential operational risks in Google's travel expenses process:

1. **Permit Final Approval by Supervisor -> Request for Payment Submitted by Employee**
   - **Explanation:** This step has high performance time (2129693.032) suggesting potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the final approval process by supervisors, which can delay subsequent expense claims.
   - **Potential Risk:** Delay in the approval process could lead to employee dissatisfaction and inefficiency in expense processing.

2. **Permit Final Approved by Director -> Request for Payment Submitted by Employee**
   - **Explanation:** With an extremely high performance time (3545389.425), this step represents a significant delay risk, indicating a cumbersome process from director-level decisions to employee submission.
   - **Potential Risk:** Extended wait times for approvals can cause backlogs and affect cash flow management for employees.

3. **Payment Handled -> Permit Rejected by Missing**
   - **Explanation:** Though less frequent (13 occurrences), this step has the highest performance time (7238248.538), indicating a critical delay when errors or missing information lead to payments being rejected.
   - **Potential Risk:** Errors or incomplete submissions resulting in rejection can cause substantial time wastage and require reprocessing, adding to the operational overhead.

4. **Request for Payment Rejected by Administration -> Request for Payment Rejected by Employee**
   - **Explanation:** The frequent rejection by administration followed by rejection acknowledgment from employees, with a significant performance time (235871.490), indicates possible communication issues or criterion misalignment.
   - **Potential Risk:** Misalignment or unclear criteria for approvals could lead to repeated rejections, frustrating employees and elongating the approval cycle.

5. **Permit Submitted by Employee -> Permit Final Approved by Supervisor**
   - **Explanation:** Although having one of the lower performance times (1856.364), this step's significant flow indicates its foundational role. Any inefficiency here will disrupt many subsequent processes.
   - **Potential Risk:** Inadequate initial permit submission quality could streamline issues across the process, underlining the importance of comprehensive first submission.

These steps highlight potential bottlenecks, misalignment, and inefficiencies that could create operational risks in the travel expenses process at Google. Addressing these areas could improve efficiency and employee satisfaction.
