To identify regulatory risks in the loan application process at Wells Fargo Bank, I will analyze the DFG model provided, focusing on structural insights and common paths. Here are the most important process steps and their explanations:

1. **W_Validate Application**:
   - **Frequency**: Very high frequency (115,590) and varied performance time.
   - **Explanation**: This step's high frequency with varying performance suggests potential risk of non-compliance due to inconsistent processing times. Delays here could lead to regulatory scrutiny for fair lending practices.

2. **W_Call After Offers**:
   - **Frequency and Performance**: High frequency (115,569) and extremely high performance time.
   - **Explanation**: Extended performance time here might indicate inefficiencies that could impact compliance, especially if communication delays affect customer decision timelines, potentially leading to customer dissatisfaction or disputes.

3. **W_Call Incomplete Files**:
   - **Frequency and Performance**: Significant frequency (113,918) with varying performance.
   - **Explanation**: Dealing with incomplete documentation is critical for compliance. Delays or errors in this step can lead to regulatory risks, particularly around documentation accuracy and completeness, essential for meeting lending standards.

4. **W_Assess Potential Fraud**:
   - **Frequency**: Lower frequency (2,866) but significant performance time.
   - **Explanation**: This step is crucial for regulatory compliance concerning fraud prevention. Inadequate assessment can lead to compliance failures, opening the bank to legal risks and potential fraud losses.

5. **W_Call Incomplete Files -> O_Accepted**:
   - **Performance**: Extremely high-performance time (462,403.858).
   - **Explanation**: This transition signifies a long delay in transitioning incomplete files to accepted offers, which can raise risks related to documentation integrity and accurate record-keeping. Regulatory bodies require prompt and accurate processing of loan applications.

These steps are critical in identifying and managing regulatory risks as they highlight potential inefficiencies, delays, and procedural gaps that could compromise compliance.
