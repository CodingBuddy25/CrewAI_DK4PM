To analyze the IT incident handling process at Volvo and identify potential IT and cyber risks, we can focus on key transitions within the Directly Follows Graph (DFG) model. Below are the most important process steps and activities, along with potential risks and causes:

1. **Accepted -> Queued (frequency = 9498, performance = 41929.828)**
   - **Risk:** Delays in incident handling if too many incidents are moved back to a queued state.
   - **Potential Causes:** Insufficient resources, lack of prioritization, or inadequate initial analysis.

2. **Completed -> Accepted (frequency = 462, performance = 237730.643)**
   - **Risk:** Reopening of completed incidents indicates potential recurrence or improper resolution.
   - **Potential Causes:** Incomplete resolution, inadequate root cause analysis, or ineffective communication of resolutions.

3. **Completed -> Completed (frequency = 5741, performance = 428739.573)**
   - **Risk:** High frequency with long performance time could indicate incidents taking too long to be resolved.
   - **Potential Causes:** Complex incidents, inefficient processes, or lack of expertise.

4. **Unmatched -> Accepted (frequency = 5, performance = 670.400)**
   - **Risk:** Issues that were previously unrecognized entering the system highlights potential vulnerabilities.
   - **Potential Causes:** Initial oversight, lack of monitoring, or failure to detect issues early.

5. **Completed -> Unmatched (frequency = 5, performance = 204574.000)**
   - **Risk:** Incidents reverting to an unmatched state signifies issues in classification or tracking.
   - **Potential Causes:** Errors in incident classification, poor tracking systems, or communication gaps.

These steps highlight delays, recurrence of issues, and insufficient incident handling as primary areas of risk in the process. Addressing these areas involves improving resources, communication, and tools used in incident management.
