3. **W_Complete application -> W_Call incomplete files**
   - **Frequency**: 22,264
   - **Performance**: 70,687.921
   - **Explanation**: This transition reflects inefficiency that can arise from regulatory documentation requirements not being clearly met or presented, causing incomplete assessments and filings.

4. **W_Call incomplete files -> O_Accepted**
   - **Frequency**: 4,783
   - **Performance**: 462,403.858
   - **Explanation**: The significant delay in processing calls to acceptance suggests issues with meeting regulatory standards on documentation or application completeness.
