# Linking the Purchase-to-Pay Process to Walmart’s Environmental Risks: A Process Mining Perspective

## Introduction

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, operates an extensive and complex supply chain, making its purchase-to-pay (P2P) process both a critical operational backbone and a focal point for environmental risk management. Given Walmart’s scale—serving over 230 million customers weekly across 10,500 stores in 24 countries—its procurement and supply chain decisions have significant environmental implications ([Walmart Inc., 2022](https://corporate.walmart.com/content/dam/corporate/documents/purpose/environmental-social-and-governance-report-archive/CDP-2022-Climate-Change-Submission.pdf)). With increasing pressure from stakeholders and regulatory bodies to address sustainability, integrating process mining into Walmart’s P2P process emerges as a strategic lever to identify, measure, and mitigate environmental risks.

This report synthesizes the latest research, case studies, and process mining literature to provide a detailed analysis of how Walmart’s P2P process intersects with environmental risks and how process mining can drive both operational and sustainability improvements.

## The Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) Process: Definition and Relevance

The P2P process encompasses all activities from the initial procurement request to the final payment for goods and services. The main stages include:

1. **Purchase Requisition**
2. **Purchase Order Creation**
3. **Goods Receipt**
4. **Invoice Receipt**
5. **Invoice Approval**
6. **Payment Processing**

Each stage generates event logs in ERP and procurement systems, which are the foundation for process mining ([QPR, 2023](https://www.qpr.com/blog/process-mining-for-purchase-to-pay-process); [Celonis, 2024](https://www.celonis.com/blog/the-power-of-process-mining-in-purchase-to-pay/)). Process mining leverages these logs to visualize, analyze, and optimize the actual process flows, uncovering inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and compliance issues.

## Environmental Risks in Walmart’s P2P Process

### 1. **Supply Chain Emissions (Scope 3)**

Walmart’s supply chain is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accounting for the majority of its environmental footprint. The company’s Project Gigaton™ aims to reduce or avoid 1 billion metric tons of supply chain emissions by 2030 ([Walmart Inc., 2022](https://corporate.walmart.com/content/dam/corporate/documents/purpose/environmental-social-and-governance-report-archive/CDP-2022-Climate-Change-Submission.pdf)). The P2P process directly influences supplier selection, order quantities, and logistics—all key drivers of Scope 3 emissions.

**Key Fact:** Walmart removed 20 million metric tons of GHGs from its global supply chain through targeted supplier engagement and data-driven initiatives ([Bamboo Rose, 2025](https://bamboorose.com/case-studies/case-study-walmart-removes-20-million-metric-tons-of-ghgs-from-its-global-supply-chain/)).

### 2. **Resource Consumption and Waste**

Procurement decisions affect the resource intensity of Walmart’s operations, from packaging materials to product design. Inefficient P2P processes can lead to over-ordering, excess inventory, and increased waste.

### 3. **Supplier Compliance and Risk**

Environmental risks also arise from inadequate supplier vetting and monitoring. Incidents such as the procurement of low-quality cotton from Indian suppliers highlight vulnerabilities in Walmart’s audit and compliance mechanisms ([StudyCorgi, 2022](https://studycorgi.com/risk-management-at-walmart-and-the-retail-industry/)).

### 4. **Process Inefficiencies**

Manual approvals, maverick buying (purchases outside approved channels), and delayed payments can obscure environmental performance data and hinder sustainability initiatives ([ProcessMaker, 2024](https://www.processmaker.com/blog/process-mining-for-procurement-what-why-and-how/)).

## Process Mining: A Strategic Tool for Environmental Risk Management

### What is Process Mining?

Process mining extracts actionable insights from event logs generated by P2P systems, revealing the real-life process flows, bottlenecks, and compliance gaps ([QPR, 2023](https://www.qpr.com/blog/process-mining-for-purchase-to-pay-process); [Celonis, 2024](https://www.celonis.com/blog/the-power-of-process-mining-in-purchase-to-pay/)). It enables:

- **Visualization:** Mapping actual vs. intended processes.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying inefficiencies and their sources.
- **KPI Monitoring:** Tracking environmental and operational performance.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Enabling targeted interventions.

### Application to Walmart’s P2P and Environmental Risks

#### 1. **Supplier Performance and Emissions Tracking**

Walmart uses supplier scorecards and platforms like Bamboo Rose SRM to collect sustainability data, benchmark emissions, and engage suppliers in reduction initiatives ([Bamboo Rose, 2025](https://bamboorose.com/case-studies/case-study-walmart-removes-20-million-metric-tons-of-ghgs-from-its-global-supply-chain/)). Process mining enhances this by:

- **Automating Data Collection:** Reducing manual errors and ensuring timely reporting.
- **Identifying Non-compliance:** Detecting suppliers who fail to meet environmental standards.
- **Benchmarking:** Comparing supplier performance across regions and categories.

#### 2. **Reducing Waste and Resource Use**

Process mining uncovers inefficiencies such as over-ordering and excess inventory, which contribute to waste. By visualizing the flow of goods and identifying rework or delays, Walmart can optimize order quantities and reduce environmental impact ([QPR, 2023](https://www.qpr.com/blog/process-mining-for-purchase-to-pay-process)).

#### 3. **Enhancing Audit and Compliance**

Automated process mining can continuously monitor procurement activities for deviations from approved processes, such as unauthorized suppliers or purchases of non-compliant goods ([StudyCorgi, 2022](https://studycorgi.com/risk-management-at-walmart-and-the-retail-industry/)). This strengthens Walmart’s ability to detect and address environmental risks in real time.

#### 4. **Supporting Strategic Initiatives (e.g., Project Gigaton™)**

Process mining provides the data backbone for large-scale sustainability programs, enabling Walmart to track progress against emission reduction targets and identify high-impact interventions ([Walmart Inc., 2022](https://corporate.walmart.com/content/dam/corporate/documents/purpose/environmental-social-and-governance-report-archive/CDP-2022-Climate-Change-Submission.pdf)).
