# Linking Process Mining, Order-to-Cash (O2C), and Bottlenecks at Procter & Gamble (P&G): An In-Depth Analysis

## Introduction

The Order-to-Cash (O2C) process is a cornerstone of operational efficiency and financial health in large enterprises such as Procter & Gamble (P&G). In today’s data-driven business environment, process mining has emerged as a critical tool for uncovering inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and opportunities for automation within O2C workflows. This report synthesizes recent findings, case studies, and academic research to provide a comprehensive analysis of how process mining can be leveraged to optimize O2C at P&G, with a focus on identifying and addressing bottlenecks and inefficiencies.

## Understanding the O2C Process

The O2C process encompasses the entire journey from receiving a customer order to collecting payment. While the basic steps are consistent across industries, the complexity increases with organizational size, product diversity, and global operations—factors that are highly relevant for P&G. The typical O2C process includes:

1. **Sales Order**: Receipt of customer order.
2. **Order Fulfillment**: Processing and preparing the order.
3. **Shipping/Delivery**: Dispatching goods to the customer.
4. **Invoicing**: Generating and sending invoices.
5. **Payment**: Receiving and reconciling payments ([mindzie, 2022](https://mindzie.com/2022/03/08/process-mining-and-order-to-cash-o2c/)).

Each step is a potential source of delay, error, or inefficiency, particularly in a multinational context like P&G’s.

## The Role of Process Mining in O2C Optimization

Process mining involves extracting event logs from enterprise systems to reconstruct the actual process flows, identify deviations from the ideal process, and pinpoint areas for improvement. Its core benefits include:

- **Fact-based process discovery**: Reveals the real, as-executed process, including all variants and exceptions.
- **Bottleneck identification**: Highlights where delays and inefficiencies occur.
- **Root cause analysis**: Enables drill-down into the causes of process issues.
- **Continuous monitoring**: Facilitates ongoing compliance and performance tracking ([ExpertBeacon, 2023](https://expertbeacon.com/process-mining-order-to-cash/); [Marketing Scoop, 2025](https://www.marketingscoop.com/ai/process-mining-order-to-cash/)).

## Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies in O2C: Insights from Process Mining

### 1. **Order Entry and Management**

- **Manual Data Entry**: Manual order entry is prone to errors and delays, especially with high order volumes. Process mining can quantify the frequency and impact of manual interventions.
- **Order Changes and Approvals**: Orders requiring manual approval or changes often experience longer cycle times. At P&G’s scale, even minor inefficiencies can have a significant cumulative impact ([mindzie, 2022](https://mindzie.com/2022/03/08/process-mining-and-order-to-cash-o2c/)).

### 2. **Credit Checks**

- **Manual vs. Automated Checks**: Orders with manual credit checks take up to twice as long to process compared to those with automated checks ([Marketing Scoop, 2025](https://www.marketingscoop.com/ai/process-mining-order-to-cash/)).
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Process mining can reveal that certain customer segments or geographies are more prone to delays due to complex credit policies.

### 3. **Inventory Allocation and Fulfillment**

- **Inventory Look-Ups**: Manual inventory checks create bottlenecks, particularly for global supply chains. Process mining has shown that automating these checks can reduce order fallout rates by over 30% ([ExpertBeacon, 2023](https://expertbeacon.com/process-mining-order-to-cash/)).
- **Order Fallout**: For example, a telecom manufacturer reduced order fallout rates by 32% after process mining revealed that 45% of fallouts were due to inventory system issues.

### 4. **Shipping and Delivery**

- **Shipping Delays**: Delays in shipping or delivery are often due to process handoffs, incomplete documentation, or system integration issues.
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Process mining enables real-time alerts when shipments are delayed, allowing for immediate corrective action ([mindzie, 2022](https://mindzie.com/2022/03/08/process-mining-and-order-to-cash-o2c/)).

### 5. **Invoicing**

- **Manual Invoice Reviews**: Manual QA and corrections in billing can extend the invoicing process from 1 day to over 5 days. Automation, guided by process mining insights, can reduce this time dramatically ([Marketing Scoop, 2025](https://www.marketingscoop.com/ai/process-mining-order-to-cash/)).
- **Invoice Errors**: Complex tax rules, especially for international clients, are a frequent source of errors. Process mining helps isolate these cases for targeted process redesign.

### 6. **Payment Collection**

- **Payment Delays**: Payment lags are often linked to upstream process inefficiencies (e.g., late invoicing, disputed charges).
- **Cash Flow Impact**: According to The Hackett Group, O2C optimization can improve working capital by 20% or more ([Marketing Scoop, 2025](https://www.marketingscoop.com/ai/process-mining-order-to-cash/)).

### 7. **End-to-End Visibility**

- **Siloed Data**: A major challenge is the lack of end-to-end visibility across O2C, especially in organizations with multiple ERP systems. Process mining bridges this gap by aggregating event logs from disparate systems ([ExpertBeacon, 2023](https://expertbeacon.com/process-mining-order-to-cash/)).

## Case Study: Process Mining at P&G

While specific internal data for P&G is not publicly available, academic research has simulated O2C process mining scenarios using datasets labeled as P&G for testing purposes ([SpringerLink, 2024](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-82225-4_49)). The analysis highlighted the following:

- **Audit Risks**: Process mining can uncover audit risks such as unauthorized order changes, duplicate invoices, and late payments.
- **Domain Knowledge Gap**: Effective process mining requires domain knowledge to interpret results and design actionable improvements—a challenge for large, diversified firms like P&G.
- **LLM Integration**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance process mining tools by injecting domain knowledge, making insights more accessible to non-experts ([SpringerLink, 2024](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-82225-4_49)).
