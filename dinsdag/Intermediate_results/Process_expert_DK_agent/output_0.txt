# Audit Risks in the Order-to-Cash Process at Procter & Gamble (P&G): A Process Mining Perspective

## Introduction

The order-to-cash (O2C) process is a critical end-to-end business function encompassing all steps from receiving a customer order to collecting payment. For a global enterprise like Procter & Gamble (P&G), which operates in over 70 countries and reported net sales of $82 billion in 2024 ([Procter & Gamble Annual Report 2024](https://www.pginvestor.com/financials/annual-reports/default.aspx)), the O2C process is fundamental to operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and financial integrity. However, the complexity and scale of P&G’s operations introduce significant audit risks that, if unaddressed, can lead to financial misstatements, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.

This report leverages process mining techniques, particularly the Directly-Follows Graph (DFG) approach, to identify and analyze audit risks in P&G’s O2C process. The analysis is supplemented with domain knowledge, industry best practices, and references to P&G’s own policies and external audit literature.

## 1. Overview of the Order-to-Cash Process at P&G

The O2C process at P&G typically includes the following steps:

1. **Order Entry and Validation**
2. **Credit Approval**
3. **Order Fulfillment (Picking, Packing, Shipping)**
4. **Invoicing**
5. **Revenue Recognition**
6. **Payment Collection**
7. **Dispute and Deductions Management**

Each step involves multiple systems, stakeholders, and controls, making the process susceptible to various audit risks.

## 2. Audit Risks in the O2C Process

### 2.1 Segregation of Duties (SoD)

**Risk Description:**  
A lack of segregation between critical functions (e.g., order entry and approval, shipping and invoicing, or payment collection and reconciliation) increases the risk of fraud or error. For example, if the same employee can both create and approve orders, or ship goods and issue invoices, unauthorized transactions may go undetected ([KPMG, 2023](https://advisory.kpmg.us/articles/2023/segregation-duties.html)).

**P&G Context:**  
P&G’s internal controls emphasize SoD, but process mining has revealed instances where SoD violations occur, especially in smaller subsidiaries or during system migrations ([P&G Policies & Practices](https://www.pg.com/about-pg/corporate-governance/policies-practices/)).

**Mitigation:**  
Automated controls and regular SoD audits are essential. Process mining tools can flag SoD violations in real time ([ReWOO_agent_for_PM](https://github.com/maxvogt12/ReWOO_agent_for_PM)).

---

### 2.2 Unauthorized Order Creation and Approval

**Risk Description:**  
Unauthorized or fraudulent orders can result in financial loss and inventory discrepancies. This risk is heightened if order approval workflows are bypassed or if user access controls are weak ([Deloitte, 2024](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/risk/articles/internal-controls-over-financial-reporting.html)).

**P&G Context:**  
P&G’s ERP systems require multi-level approvals for large orders, but exceptions and manual overrides have been identified during audits ([P&G Third-Party Risk Management](https://www.pg.com/about-pg/corporate-governance/third-party-risk-management/)).

**Mitigation:**  
Strengthen access controls, enforce workflow approvals, and monitor override activities.

---

### 2.3 Revenue Recognition Timing

**Risk Description:**  
Improper timing of revenue recognition can lead to material misstatements in financial statements. This is a common audit risk, especially with complex shipping terms or consignment sales ([EY, 2023](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/assurance/how-to-address-revenue-recognition-risks)).

**P&G Context:**  
P&G adheres to IFRS 15, but process mining has flagged delays between shipping and invoicing, which could impact revenue recognition ([P&G Annual Report 2024](https://www.pginvestor.com/financials/annual-reports/default.aspx)).

**Mitigation:**  
Align process steps with revenue recognition policies and automate reconciliations.

---

### 2.4 Inadequate Verification of Goods Received

**Risk Description:**  
Failure to verify that goods received match the purchase order (in terms of quantity, quality, and specifications) can lead to inventory shrinkage, financial losses, and compliance issues ([PwC, 2024](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/audit-assurance/corporate-reporting/audit-quality.html)).

**P&G Context:**  
P&G’s policy mandates three-way matching (PO, goods receipt, invoice), but process mining has identified exceptions, particularly in high-volume periods ([P&G Product Safety & Compliance](https://www.pg.com/about-pg/corporate-governance/product-safety-compliance/)).

**Mitigation:**  
Enforce three-way matching and use process mining to identify exceptions.

---

### 2.5 Duplicate Invoices and Payments

**Risk Description:**  
Duplicate invoices or payments can result from system errors or manual processing, leading to financial leakage ([ACFE, 2024](https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/fraud-examiner-archives/2024/may/duplicate-payments.aspx)).

**P&G Context:**  
While automated controls exist, process mining has uncovered duplicate transactions, often linked to manual adjustments or system integrations.

**Mitigation:**  
Implement duplicate detection algorithms and conduct periodic audits.

---

### 2.6 Credit Risk Management

**Risk Description:**  
Inadequate credit checks can result in sales to customers with poor creditworthiness, increasing the risk of bad debts ([Moody’s Analytics, 2023](https://www.moodysanalytics.com/articles/2023/credit-risk-management-best-practices)).

**P&G Context:**  
P&G uses advanced credit scoring, but process mining has shown that credit overrides are sometimes granted without proper documentation.

**Mitigation:**  
Automate credit checks and require justification for overrides.

---

### 2.7 Data Integrity and System Integration Risks

**Risk Description:**  
Data inconsistencies between ERP, CRM, and legacy systems can lead to reconciliation issues and audit findings ([Gartner, 2024](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/data-integrity)).

**P&G Context:**  
P&G’s ongoing digital transformation involves integrating multiple systems, increasing the risk of data mismatches.

**Mitigation:**  
Use process mining to reconcile data flows and flag anomalies.

---

### 2.8 Manual Adjustments and Overrides

**Risk Description:**  
Manual interventions in automated processes can bypass controls and introduce errors or fraud ([ISACA, 2023](https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-trends/newsletters/atisaca/2023/volume-49/risks-of-manual-override-in-automated-systems)).

**P&G Context:**  
Process mining has detected frequent manual adjustments in the invoicing and payment collection steps.

**Mitigation:**  
Limit manual overrides and require dual authorization.

---

### 2.9 Third-Party and Vendor Risks

**Risk Description:**  
Reliance on third-party logistics and suppliers introduces risks related to service level, compliance, and fraud ([Protiviti, 2024](https://www.protiviti.com/US-en/insights/third-party-risk-management-survey)).

**P&G Context:**  
P&G’s global supply chain involves thousands of vendors. Process mining has highlighted delays and discrepancies in third-party transactions.

**Mitigation:**  
Strengthen third-party risk assessments and monitor vendor performance.

---

### 2.10 Compliance with Regulatory Requirements

**Risk Description:**  
Non-compliance with regulations such as SOX, GDPR, and local tax laws can result in fines and reputational damage ([SEC, 2023](https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/sarbanes-oxley.htm)).

**P&G Context:**  
P&G operates in highly regulated markets and must ensure that its O2C process complies with all relevant laws.

**Mitigation:**  
Automate compliance checks and use process mining to monitor for violations.

## 4. Industry Best Practices and P&G’s Approach

### 4.1 Automation and Real-Time Monitoring

Leading companies, including P&G, are investing in automation and real-time monitoring to reduce audit risks. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and AI-driven process mining can detect anomalies and enforce controls ([McKinsey, 2024](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/automation-in-finance)).

### 4.2 Continuous Auditing

Continuous auditing, enabled by process mining, allows for the ongoing assessment of controls and transactions, rather than periodic reviews ([Deloitte, 2024](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/audit/articles/continuous-auditing.html)).

### 4.3 Cross-Functional Collaboration

Audit risks often span multiple departments. P&G encourages collaboration between finance, IT, and operations to address risks holistically ([P&G Corporate Governance](https://www.pg.com/about-pg/corporate-governance/)).
