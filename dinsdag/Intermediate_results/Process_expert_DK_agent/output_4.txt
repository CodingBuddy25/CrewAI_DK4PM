## 1. The Purchase-to-Pay Process and Its Environmental Impact

The P2P process typically includes the following phases: purchase requisition, purchase order creation, goods receipt, invoice receipt, invoice approval, and invoice payment ([QPR, 2023](https://www.qpr.com/blog/process-mining-for-purchase-to-pay-process)). Each phase generates data and has potential environmental impacts, such as resource use, waste generation, and carbon emissions, especially at the scale of Walmart’s operations.

Walmart’s supply chain is a major contributor to its environmental footprint, with significant impacts arising from sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, transportation, and disposal ([FasterCapital, 2024](https://fastercapital.com/content/Sustainability--Environmental-Consequences-of-the-Walmart-Effect.html)). The company’s efforts to address these impacts include initiatives like Project Gigaton, which aims to reduce one billion metric tons of greenhouse gases from its global value chain by 2030 ([Supply Chain Dive, 2024](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/walmart-project-gigaton-scope-3-supplier-emissions-ron-voglewede/710733/)).

## 3. Walmart’s P2P Process and Environmental Risks

### 3.1. Scale and Complexity

Walmart operates over 11,000 stores in 27 countries, with a supply chain spanning thousands of suppliers ([MBA Knowledge Base, n.d.](https://www.mbaknol.com/management-case-studies/case-study-of-walmart-procurement-and-distribution/)). This scale amplifies the environmental consequences of inefficiencies in the P2P process, such as:

- Excessive transportation (fuel use, emissions)
- Over-ordering or maverick buying (resource waste)
- Delayed payments (disincentivizing sustainable suppliers)

### 3.2. Environmental Initiatives

Walmart has made notable progress in sustainability, including:

- Committing to source 50% of its energy from renewables by 2025 ([FasterCapital, 2024](https://fastercapital.com/content/Sustainability--Environmental-Consequences-of-the-Walmart-Effect.html))
- Reducing plastic packaging and encouraging suppliers to adopt sustainable practices
- Launching Project Gigaton to cut supply chain emissions ([Supply Chain Dive, 2024](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/walmart-project-gigaton-scope-3-supplier-emissions-ron-voglewede/710733/))

Despite these efforts, Walmart’s supply chain remains a significant source of environmental risk, especially in terms of Scope 3 emissions (those generated by suppliers).

## 4. How Process Mining Can Address Environmental Risks in Walmart’s P2P

### 4.1. Data-Driven Sustainability

Process mining can extract and analyze data relevant to environmental KPIs, such as carbon emissions per transaction, packaging waste, and supplier sustainability scores ([Apolix, 2024](https://apolix.global/how-can-process-mining-create-value-for-sustainability/)). By integrating emissions data into the P2P process, Walmart can:

- Track progress towards sustainability targets in real time
- Identify high-emission suppliers or products
- Optimize procurement decisions for lower environmental impact

### 4.2. Root Cause Analysis of Environmental Inefficiencies

Process mining enables Walmart to pinpoint the root causes of inefficiencies that drive environmental risks, such as:

- Repeated or unnecessary purchase orders (leading to excess inventory and waste)
- Free-text requisitions that bypass preferred, sustainable suppliers ([Celonis, 2024](https://www.celonis.com/blog/the-power-of-process-mining-in-purchase-to-pay/))
- Delays in invoice processing that prevent taking advantage of early payment discounts or sustainable supplier incentives

### 4.3. Automation and Compliance

Automating routine P2P tasks (e.g., converting requisitions to purchase orders, invoice matching) can reduce paper use, accelerate cycle times, and ensure compliance with sustainability policies ([QPR, 2023](https://www.qpr.com/blog/process-mining-for-purchase-to-pay-process)). Process mining can monitor compliance in real time and flag deviations, such as purchases from non-approved or non-sustainable suppliers.

### 5.1. Walmart’s Green Supply Chain

Walmart’s green supply chain initiatives, such as sustainable sourcing and logistics optimization, have been recognized for reducing greenhouse gases and improving fuel efficiency ([Academia.edu, n.d.](https://www.academia.edu/6977823/A_Case_Study_of_Wal_Marts_Green_Supply_Chain_Management)). Process mining can further enhance these efforts by providing granular, actionable data on process steps that contribute most to emissions.

### 5.2. Discount Realization and Working Capital

A Celonis case study with Fresenius Kabi (a global healthcare provider) showed that process mining increased cash discount realization from 61% to 90%, saving $550K in capital costs ([Celonis, 2024](https://www.celonis.com/blog/the-power-of-process-mining-in-purchase-to-pay/)). For Walmart, similar improvements could free up working capital for sustainability investments.

### 5.3. Risk Management and Traceability

Walmart uses blockchain for end-to-end traceability in food supply chains, reducing illness risk and improving safety ([Desklib, 2023](https://desklib.com/study-documents/walmart-risk-management-case/)). Process mining can complement this by monitoring compliance and identifying process gaps that may lead to environmental or safety incidents.
