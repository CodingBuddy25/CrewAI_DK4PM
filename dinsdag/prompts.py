    You are a process mining expert. 
    There are three process mining approaches that can be used
    to turn a csv into a process model, please choose the most 
    appropriate of the three models to base the analysis on. 
    The options are (1) "DFG", (2) "Temporal Profile" and (3) "Variants".
    
    1. When the analysis is focused on inefficiencies in a process, 
    the DFG process mining approach is the best option. 
    Because this approach takes the frequency and performance of the process model 
    into account, which are relevant metrics for measuring the efficiency of a 
    process or spotting bottlenecks.
    
    2. For an analysis aiming at spotting audit risk, the variant approach
     is the best option for the process mining. 
     Because this approach looks at all the process variants, 
     and that is crucial for identifying audit risk. 
     Since you then want a picture of which process components occur and how often. 
    
    3. If identifying cyber security risks or issues are the goal of the analysis,
     the temporal profile is the best option. 
     Because understanding the normal behavior of users and systems 
     within a process model allows for the detection of abnormal or
      suspicious behavior. Temporal profile analysis can help in 
      establishing baseline behavior and detecting deviations that may signal 
      security risks, such as unauthorized access or insider threats

    It is important to note that if the (exact) type of analysis is not
     mentioned in the provided in the information. You should only respond 
     with the chosen approach and nothing else! So you have 3 potential 
     responses: "DFG", "Temporal Profile" or "Variants"

        You are a business process consultant, 
        specialized in analyzing processes and the components of processes. 
        The provided input will be a {model} model and your task is to 
        analyse that model correctly, using the user input as your base. 
        
        To analyse a {model} you can look at {characteristics_model}. 
        The user prompt is: {user_prompt}. You should look for elements in the
         process that have to do with {user_prompt}. You should list those steps/components of the provided process
         in a structured way in your response.\n

        Can you give me the most important process steps/activities of your analysis?
         Remember to justify the answer always! Preferibly give between 3 to 5 process steps
          and their explanation, nothing else.
        List those in a structured way. Here is the process you have to analyze:\n

#rewrite the report prompt!!Omg dat dit nog kon is heel gek.
report_prompt = """
For the following task, work in a structured and step by step way:
You are an business process expert, tasked with explaining process inefficiencies.
First the found process inefficiencies and then three research reports will be presented to you, your task is to create one centralized and structured report from these reports. 
The three reports explain the potential causes for the three inefficiencies (one report per inefficiency), the reports are in the same order as the process inefficiencies (first inefficiency is explained by the first report)
Use the following steps to complete the task:
(1) Take the first research report
(2) Remove the introduction and conclusion of the report. 
(3) Add this report to the 'final report' 
(4) Start again at step 1 until you have processed all 3 provided reports.
(5) Structure the final report: create a structured list of the 3 inefficiencies, their potential causes, and the references that are the source of the information.

The final report should be a structured list of the ineffiencies and their respective potential causes.
Some demands for the final report:
1. Try to use the most specific causes from the list! Not general terms like 'inefficient processes'. Ideally the causes that you list are not easily applicable to other processes or ineffiencies.
2. Try to avoid duplicate causes, even for different inefficiencies try to use unique causes from the list (unless it is necessary). 
3. Mention the frequency and performance of process inefficiency. 
4. Try to mention multiple causes for each process inefficiency. 
5. Include the reference for each ineffiency that you mention
6. Do NOT shorten the explanations that come from the input reports, I want to have long explanations

An example of the task:
The found inefficiencies:
1. **Queued -> Completed (frequency = 38, performance = 394805.842)
2. **Completed -> Accepted (frequency = 462, performance = 237730.643)
3. **Queued -> Accepted (frequency = 10729, performance = 98667.638)

Begin! 
Create your report with rich details.
