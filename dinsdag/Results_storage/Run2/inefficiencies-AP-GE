# Identifying Process Inefficiencies in the Accounts Payable Process at General Electric (GE)

## Introduction

Accounts Payable (AP) is a vital component of any organization’s financial management system, and General Electric (GE) is no exception. As an industry giant, the efficiency of GE's AP processes directly impacts its overall financial health and relationships with suppliers. This report aims to identify process inefficiencies in GE's AP methodology, examining its key steps, and uncovering potential causes of these inefficiencies through reference to a Directed Flow Graph (DFG) analysis of the AP process. By connecting findings from PM_agent, we will explore five crucial steps—Invoice Receipt, Invoice Verification, Approval Process, Payment Processing, and Invoice Archiving—and assess common inefficiencies while proposing best practices for improvement.

## Invoice Receipt -> Invoice Verification

The first step in the AP process is **Invoice Receipt**, where invoices are captured from various sources such as email, post, or supplier portals. It serves as a critical entry point for managing a company’s financial obligations. However, delays at this stage can lead to bottlenecks in the overall process. Research highlights that 30% of organizations experience delays due to manual handling of paper invoices ([MineralTree](https://www.mineraltree.com/blog/internal-controls-for-accounts-payable-best-practices-tips/)).

Following receipt, the next step is **Invoice Verification**. This stage involves validating the legitimacy of the invoices against purchase orders and services rendered. A high incidence of errors—whether in data entry or invoice mismatches—can lead to rework and additional processing cycles ([Medius](https://www.medius.com/blog/common-accounts-payable-problems/)). Studies suggest inefficient data verification methods can upsurge processing time by 50%, underscoring the need for integrated technologies that minimize reliance on manual inputs. For GE, implementing electronic invoicing systems could alleviate such inefficiencies by automating invoice capture and verification, ensuring higher data accuracy and faster processing times.

## Invoice Verification -> Approval Process

After verification, the process transitions to the **Approval Process**, a critical juncture where multiple stakeholders review the invoices for authorization. Often characterized by loops where invoices may need to be resent for further information or corrections, this step can be prone to delays. In fact, research by BofA indicates that significant inefficiencies stem from prolonged approval timelines due to lack of standardized processes ([BofA](https://business.bofa.com/en-us/content/5-accounts-payable-best-practices.html)). If stakeholders are unclear about their roles or lack access to necessary documents, it can further slow down approvals, leading to strained vendor relationships.

The AP approval workflow can benefit from automation tools, as efficient software solutions help set visible benchmarks for approval turnarounds. Automating notifications to remind stakeholders of pending approvals shifts the reliance from manual follow-ups to automated workflow management, thus expediting invoice processing times and enhancing supplier trust.

## Approval Process -> Payment Processing

Upon approval, the next stage is **Payment Processing**, where the actual payment to suppliers is executed. Bottlenecks at this stage often arise from discrepancies between approval, budgeting constraints, or failure to comply with internal controls. High variability in processing times can result in lost discounts for early payments and can harm relationships with vendors ([Zip](https://ziphq.com/blog/accounts-payable-process)). Research indicates that organizations experience payment delays due to inadequate alignment between AP functions and cash flow management ([Deloitte](https://deloitte.com)).

For GE, streamlining payment processes through integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems could minimize delays. Automating payment scheduling and aligning payments with cash flow forecasts ensures timely settlements, enhances supplier satisfaction, and reduces the risk of late fees.

## Payment Processing -> Invoice Archiving

Finally, the last step is **Invoice Archiving**. Traditionally perceived as less critical, the management of processed invoices is essential for compliance and future audits. A common inefficiency arises from poor storage systems that complicate information retrieval ([Gartner](https://gartner.com)). GE's AP team must ensure that invoices are archived in a structured electronic format that allows for easy access and retrieval.

Additionally, neglecting this step can lead to challenges during audits, potentially resulting in compliance violations which can have far-reaching financial implications. Emphasizing the importance of electronic archiving supports not only operational efficiency but aids in maintaining a well-documented trail of transactions that aids compliance as well as audit readiness.

## Conclusion

Identifying inefficiencies in the AP process at General Electric is crucial for optimizing financial workflows. The analysis of the five process steps—Invoice Receipt, Invoice Verification, Approval Process, Payment Processing, and Invoice Archiving—reveals multiple areas for improvement. By leveraging automation, enhancing management workflows, and ensuring structured archiving systems, GE can remedy current inefficiencies and foster stronger relationships with its suppliers, leading to overall improved operational performance.
