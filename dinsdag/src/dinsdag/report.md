## Environmental Risks in Walmart’s Purchase-to-Pay Process

In analyzing the purchase-to-pay (P2P) process at Walmart, it becomes evident that environmental risks arise at various steps, raising concerns about sustainability and ecological footprints. This report investigates the environmental risks in Walmart's P2P process by examining crucial steps, identifying potential causes for these risks, and providing insights into solutions. The steps analyzed include Purchase Order Creation, Order Approval, Goods Receipt, Invoice Processing, and Payment Authorization. Each step is crucial for understanding how Walmart's P2P process can lead to environmental impacts, particularly considering the company's vast supply chain and its role in sustainability.

### Step 1: Purchase Order Creation -> Order Approval

The first step in Walmart's P2P process is the **Purchase Order Creation** which initiates the procurement of goods. Environmental risks emerge during this phase, primarily due to the impulsive ordering of goods without proper assessment of need versus supply chain impact. This can lead to overproduction, excessive inventory, and ultimately resource wastage. High order volumes can strain environmental resources, as highlighted by Investopedia's exploration of P2P workflows which note that excessive ordering leads to inventory accumulation and increased waste (Investopedia, 2023). When goods are ordered impulsively, it disconnects the alignment between business demands and sustainability initiatives, raising the risk of environmental degradation linked to excessive manufacturing and transportation emissions (Walmart Upgrading Source-to-Pay Processes, Progressive Grocer).

### Step 2: Order Approval -> Goods Receipt 

The **Order Approval** step involves multiple stakeholder assessments, often leading to extended delays in decision-making. This bureaucratic bottleneck can introduce environmental risks as it may lead to increased urgency at later stages, thus promoting rushed production and transportation processes (Challenges in Walmart’s Purchase-to-Pay Process, International Journal of Procurement Management). Delayed decision-making can also force suppliers to expedite deliveries, causing higher levels of emissions from transport vehicles and inefficient routing (Supply Chain Management and P2P System Explained, Supply Chain Digital). This direct link between approval delays and environmental consequences underscores the need for a streamlined decision-making process to minimize pressure on stakeholders and enhance sustainability.

### Step 3: Goods Receipt -> Invoice Processing

Upon receipt of goods, discrepancies between ordered and received items can arise, leading to inefficiencies in the **Goods Receipt** step. When errors occur, unresolved discrepancies may necessitate additional shipping and handling, ultimately contributing to increased carbon footprints (How Walmart Ensures Timely Invoice Processing, Business Insights). According to the Journal of Business Research, this increased logistical demand leads to more transportation use, which is a critical source of greenhouse gas emissions in supply chains (Evaluating the Effectiveness of Walmart's Purchase-to-Pay Process, Journal of Business Research). It's crucial to develop robust quality assurance methods at this step to mitigate environmental impacts associated with logistical errors.

### Step 4: Invoice Processing -> Payment Authorization 

As invoices are processed, the **Invoice Processing** step becomes critical for advancing to payment. High volumes of simultaneous invoices can lead to processing delays, prompting companies to prioritize speed over sustainability (Walmart's E-Payment System: Revolutionizing Payment Processing, Fintech Magazine). A failure to process invoices on time can result in delayed payments, which in turn may encourage suppliers to increase prices to cover costs incurred from late payment penalties. This reaction may push suppliers towards less environmentally conscious methods of logistics to maintain profitability (What Walmart’s Supply Chain Can Teach Us About Accounts Payable, AP Now).

### Step 5: Payment Authorization

Finally, the **Payment Authorization** step represents the culmination of the P2P process which, when flawed, has significant environmental implications. Delays in this step lead to mounting pressure on supplier relationships, which can result in suppliers prioritizing rapid production methods, often at the expense of sustainability (Walmart and Its Vendors: Understanding the Purchase-To-Pay Cycle, Vendor Management Insights). This pressure may cause suppliers to overlook eco-friendly practices, opting for economically expedient methods that yield negative environmental outcomes.

## Addressing Environmental Risks

To effectively mitigate these environmental risks identified in Walmart's P2P process, several strategies can be implemented:
1. **Enhancing Transparency and Communication** throughout the P2P process can assist in making accurate purchase decisions and fostering partnerships that align with sustainability goals.
2. **Investing in Automation Technology** may streamline processes in order approval and invoice management, reducing bottlenecks and optimizing inventory levels.
3. **Implementing Environmental Guidelines** during the supplier selection and goods receipt phases can ensure that procurement supports Walmart’s sustainability commitments, therefore fostering more eco-friendly supplier practices.

The recognition of these environmental risks and their implications throughout Walmart’s supply chain is critical as the company strives to meet sustainability objectives while improving operational efficiencies. By addressing the bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the P2P process, Walmart can enhance its overall impact on environmental stewardship within the retail sector.
