Recent research and case studies highlight recurring issues such as manual interventions, data inaccuracies, system integration flaws, and process variability, all of which contribute to inefficiencies and bottlenecks ([K‰‰ri‰ & Shamsuzzoha, 2024](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ijppm-01-2022-0050/full/html)).

## Overview of P&Gís O2C Process

P&Gís O2C process typically includes the following phases:

| Phase                  | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Order Entry            | Customer order is received and entered into the system                       |
| Credit Management      | Credit checks and risk assessments are performed                             |
| Order Fulfillment      | Products are picked, packed, and shipped                                     |
| Billing & Invoicing    | Invoices are generated and sent to customers                                |
| Payment Collection     | Payments are received and reconciled                                         |
| Customer Service       | Post-order support and issue resolution                                      |

This process is supported by integrated ERP systems (notably SAP), process mining tools (e.g., Celonis), and digital supply chain platforms ([Panmore Institute, 2024](https://panmore.com/procter-gamble-operations-management-10-decisions-productivity)).

## Identified Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies

### Excessive Manual Work and Data Inaccuracies

Manual interventions in order entry, pricing, and invoicing lead to errors, delays, and rework. For example, a case study in the energy sector found that manual data entry caused frequent invoice cancellations, negatively impacting customer experience ([K‰‰ri‰ & Shamsuzzoha, 2024](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ijppm-01-2022-0050/full/html)). This aligns with the 'Send Invoice -> Prepare Goods for Shipment' step, where potential issues with invoicing being sent before goods are ready for shipment were identified.

### System Integration and Automation Gaps

While P&G has invested in SAP and other digital tools, integration gaps remain. For example, the Allegro system was cited as a source of system errors, necessitating manual workarounds and causing delays ([K‰‰ri‰ & Shamsuzzoha, 2024](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ijppm-01-2022-0050/full/html)). This is evident in the 'Customer Credit Check -> Customer Credit Check' step, suggesting multiple credit checks being performed on the same customer due to inadequate integration.

### Process Variability and Lack of Standardization

P&G operates multiple manufacturing and distribution sites globally. Variability in process execution leads to inconsistent performance and complicates root cause analysis ([Nulogy Case Study, 2018](https://www.supplychainbrain.com/ext/resources/0-whitepapers/Nulogy/CaseStudy_PG2018.pdf)). This is reflected in the 'Order Validation -> Order Validation' step, indicating a potential risk of duplicate orders being validated due to lack of standardization.

### Bottlenecks in Credit and Payment Processing

Credit invoicing delays introduce additional steps and increase the risk of payment delays ([K‰‰ri‰ & Shamsuzzoha, 2024](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ijppm-01-2022-0050/full/html)). This is evident in the 'Payment Received -> Goods Shipped' step, where a potential delay in payments being processed was identified.

### Lack of Real-Time Visibility and Performance Metrics

Without real-time dashboards and KPIs, it is difficult for P&G to monitor O2C performance, identify bottlenecks, and drive continuous improvement ([K‰‰ri‰ & Shamsuzzoha, 2024](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ijppm-01-2022-0050/full/html)). This aligns with the 'Order Validation -> Order Approval' step, suggesting a lengthy approval process due to lack of real-time visibility.

## Root Causes of O2C Inefficiencies

| Root Cause                  | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| System Errors/Integration   | Disparate systems and integration failures create process gaps               |
| Manual Data Handling        | Reliance on manual entry increases error rates and slows processing          |
| Process Complexity          | Multiple approval layers and exceptions add to process time                  |
